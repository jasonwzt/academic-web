abstract: I offer two extensions on Pagel (2016)â€™s reference-dependent preference and study their aggregate implications in a consumption-based asset pricing model. I first extend time-separable utility to recursive utility, which allows the model to reproduce crucial asset pricing moments with a simple IID process for consumption growth. Second, I estimate and introduce a first-order autoregression consumption shock, and I find that it improves model performance by smoothing interest rates. My additional finding is that the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is more sensitive to asset prices given the recursive preference.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Two additional extensions improve the performances of a consumption-based asset pricing model of loss aversion preference and lead to high sensitivity of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution to asset prices.
